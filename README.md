# CardGameAR

 *Inspired by the card game War, CardMastAR is a simple card fight game with a sprinkle of AR action. Our team employed the Unity game engine to create a 3D game written in C#. The Vuforia platform was incorporated to enable the creation of the augmented reality game for iOS and Android devices, making it possible for users to view 3D characters in action through the camera of their mobile devices in real-time. PUN was integrated to connect and match players for a room-based multiplayer game experience. It was a rewarding challenge to learn C#, the primary programming language used for the engine, and to get familiar with the scripting API that Unity offers for creating the game logic.*
